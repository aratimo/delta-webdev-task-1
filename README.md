Delta WebDev Task 1: Piano Tiles Game

Mode: Normal

Game Logic:

- A random tile of the grid lights up.

- If the user clicks on the correct tile, it proceeds to the next round where along with the last round's tiles, one more tile lights up sequentially.

- This continues until the user clicks on one of the wrong tiles or till all tiles of the grid are used.
